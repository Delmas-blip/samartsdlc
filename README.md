2. Project Overview
•	Purpose:.  
                The purpose of smartSDLC is to integrate AI into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), enabling faster delivery, higher code quality, improved project predictability, and reduced human error. The system acts as a co-pilot for developers, project managers, and QA teams, automating repetitive tasks and offering intelligent insights

•	Features:
o	AI Requirements Analyzer
	Key Point: Natural language understanding
	Functionality: Converts business requirements into structured user stories, acceptance criteria, and test cases.
o	Code Generation & Review
	Key Point: Automated coding support
	Functionality: Suggests code snippets, reviews commits for bugs/security issues, and enforces coding standards.
o	Automated Testing Assistant
	Key Point: Test case generation
	Functionality: Generates unit/integration test cases, validates coverage, and simulates edge cases.
o	Project Timeline Forecaster
	Key Point: Predictive project management
	Functionality: Uses ML to forecast sprint velocity, backlog burn-down, and delivery risks.
o	Defect Prediction & Anomaly Detection
	Key Point: Early issue detection
	Functionality: Identifies modules with high defect probability based on commit history, churn, and complexity.
o	Documentation Generator
	Key Point: Always-updated docs
	Functionality: Creates and maintains technical/project documentation automatically from code and commits.
o	Conversational DevOps Bot
	Key Point: Natural language interface
	Functionality: Allows team members to query project status, deployments, and issues using chat.

3. Architecture
•	     Frontend (Dashboard – Streamlit/Gradio):
Interactive UI for project managers, developers, and testers. Provides dashboards, backlog visualization, test coverage reports, and DevOps status.
•	    Backend (FastAPI / Node.js):
Exposes APIs for requirements analysis, code review, forecasting, and test generation.
•	   LLM Integration (Watsonx / OpenAI / Anthropic):
Large Language Models used for natural language understanding, code review, documentation, and test case generation.
•	   Vector Database (Pinecone / Weaviate):
Stores embeddings of requirements, project documentation, and historical issues for semantic search and traceability.
•	  ML Modules (Forecasting & Risk Detection):
Predicts delivery risks, identifies potential bottlenecks, and recommends optimizations using historical sprint/project data.
•	   DevOps Integration:
Connects with GitHub/GitLab, Jira, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes for CI/CD pipeline intelligence.

4. Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
•	Python 3.9+ (for AI modules)
•	Node.js (for optional backend services)
•	Access to LLM APIs (Watsonx, OpenAI, or Anthropic)
•	GitHub/GitLab integration tokens
•	Docker & Kubernetes (for deployment pipeline)
Installation Process:
1.	Clone the repository.
2.	Install backend dependencies (requirements.txt).
3.	Configure .env with API keys and integration tokens.
4.	Start FastAPI backend server.
5.	Launch frontend dashboard with Streamlit/Gradio.
6.	Connect to project repo + CI/CD pipeline.
